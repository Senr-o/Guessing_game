Hello to whoever is gonna read this !
This is the first bit of code I ever coded trully by myself. 
Without a tutorial I mean, i obviously googled some of the stuff to understand what I was doing. 
I don't know how to use git and github properly, it took me like half an hour to put my code in this repository. 
I try to learn coding, any advice is welcomed!
Also, english is my not my first language :)
